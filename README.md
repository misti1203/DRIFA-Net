Figure 1. Detailed architecture of DRIFA-Net. Key components include: (A) the target-specific multimodal fusion learning (TMFL)
phase, followed by (B) an uncertainty quantification (UQ) phase. TMFL phase comprises a robust residual attention (RRA) block, shown
in (C), and utilizes multi-branch fusion attention (MFA), an additional MFA module for further refinement of local representations, a
multimodal information fusion attention (MIFA) module for improved multimodal representation learning, and multitask learning (MTL)
for handling multiple classification tasks. During (UQ) phase, the reliability of DRIFA-Net predictions are assessed.

Figure 2. (a) Multi-branch fusion attention (MFA) module.Key components include hierarchical information fusion attention (HIFA) for diverse 
local information enhancement and channelwise local information attention (CLIA) for improved channelspecific representation learning.

Figure 3. (a) Multimodal information fusion attention (MIFA) module. This module includes multimodal global information fusion attention (MGIFA) (shown in b) and multimodal local information fusion attention (MLIFA) (shown in c).

GRAD-CAM technique on two benchmark datasets D1 and D3. (a) and (g) display the original images, while (b) and (h) present results for
Gloria, (c) and (i) for MTF with MA, (d) and (j) for CAF, (e) and (k) for MTTU-Net, and (f) and (l) for our proposed DRIFA-Net.
